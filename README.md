# SCP-012

SCP-012 is a plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory that utilizes the EXILED framework.\
It implements SCP-012 with its corresponding room, using Michal78900's MapEditorReborn plugin.

This is the edited version for brazillian server Apollo Space

## Features

- The room will automatically spawn in LczToilets, where a new door will be created.
- Players will be attracted to the Bad Composition with a configurable force.
- Players who approach will begin to experience configurable effects.
- The distance at which the Bad Composition acts is configurable. [Not recommended, as it may attract players outside the room]
- Players who get too close to the Bad Composition will be compelled to complete it, while repeating configurable phrases, and   ultimately, they will die from exsanguination.


## How to install

No binaries will be distributed, if you want to use it that much (not recomended) then build it yourself.
